          <h1>ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY</h1>
          <p>
          Steel City Ruby Conference is dedicated to providing a
          harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
          size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
          participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
          appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference
          participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
          the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference
          organizers.
          </p>

          <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
          sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
          stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
          disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
          and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
          harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
          Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
          activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
          particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
          or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
          sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
          sexualized environment.
          </p>

          <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
          </p>

          <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
          harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
          conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by
          t-shirts/special badges/head sets.
          </p>

          <p>
          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact
          hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
          otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
          duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
