        <h3>DevOps for the Rubyist Soul</h3>
        <p>
        Ruby developers have many great options for simply hosting their
        web applications. But what happens when your product outgrows
        Heroku? Managing your own servers can be an intimidating task for
        the average developer. This session will cover the lessons we've
        learned at Braintree from building and maintaining our
        infrastructure. It will cover how we leverage Ruby to automate and
        control all of our environments. Some specific topics we'll cover:
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>Orchestrating servers with capistrano</li>
          <li>Using puppet for configuration management</li>
          <li>Our cap and puppet workflow using git</li>
          <li>How vagrant can provide a sane test environment</li>
          <li>Some pitfalls you should avoid"</li>

        I've been an avid programmer since I was a kid typing BASIC listings into our
        Atari 800 at home. I'm now a senior Rails Developer for PhishMe and love to
        write and hack and want to add "talk" to that list.

        <h3>Deliberate Git</h3>
        <p>
        Git. It seems that everyone is using it and that everyone is using it in
        different ways. Always rebase, never rebase, always fast-forward, always
        no-fast forward, rewrite history, never rewrite history, always squash,
        git-flow, github-flow, commit driven development, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
        Like a good Unix command, git doesn't care how you use it. It enables a wide
        variety of repository workflows. Used effectively git can spin the tale of your
        codebase: where it's been, where it's going, the problems encountered along the
        way. Used ineffectively your git history can become a dense mess of merges
        ballooning out into a multilane spaghetti highway that's impossible for a
        newcomer to navigate.
        </p>

        <p>
        My talk will describe how to safely, sanely, and deliberately use git
        to write the story of your code using three simple rules:
        </p>

        <p>
        1. Use present tense commits. Rather than describe what has happened, tell what
        the commit actively does. This is not just a semantic change, but helps to
        change the way you think about the commit. In the past tense it makes little
        conceptual sense to edit commits. When commits are written in the present,
        active tense then it is an easy mental jump to being able to rewrite, reorder,
        or remove commits.
        </p>

        <p>
        2. Tell your development story. You don't need to preserve every false path
        like a dashed line trail in the Family Circus in your master branch. If it's
        needed or useful, you can safely store the development history in the branch
        itself and only tell the actual story in master.
        </p>

        <p>
        3. Don't tell other developer's stories. Use git to work with the commits made
        by other developers, not to rewrite them after the fact.
        </p>

        <p>
        The techniques I'll share include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>how to rebase against your own branch to fixup, change, and otherwise edit your commits</li>
          <li>how to rebase against upstream commits to clarify your own commits</li>
          <li>how to recognize when your repo history is about to get confusing by examining the incoming and outgoing commits between branches</li>
          <li>using git-stash effectively to save off pieces of work</li>
          <li>using private local branches to isolate your development from public changes until you are ready</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Keep Software Weird</h3>
        <p>
        How much code coverage does it take it ship a minimal viable product?
        How many Scrum Certifications does it take to make your team agile? How many
        languages learned make a journeyman a master? Currently, in software, there is
        an expressed desire to be taken seriously as craftspeople. To this end, we've
        introduced process, metrics and quantifiable boundaries as goal posts to hold
        up to those who may not understand what is involved in shipping quality
        software. As this practice becomes normal, developers are faced with an
        ever-expanding landscape of techniques, practices and pressure from thought
        leaders to take extra course work or certifications to validate the assertion
        that you are, in fact, a software developer. While some may see this as a
        necessary evolution of our field, I see it as a albatross round the neck of the
        creative developer looking to explore the depths of what is possible. While the
        safety of a well worn path may provide solace to the uninitiated, I find
        dogmatic implementation oppressive and exclusionary to those interested in
        exploring alternative approaches to solving problems with technology. Join me
        in an exploration of what I believe makes us unique as a subculture in this
        business world; examples of how we came to be by challenging the established
        idioms of the past in order to move forward into something exciting and new. To
        be our best we must be willing to dive into the unknown, to loose the binds of
        convention and explore the vast expanse of the unfamiliar. We must dare to be
        wrong, to be new, to be foolish, to be amazing and keep software weird.

        journey</a> of becoming a better problem solver. His current focus is to become a
        full-stack developer who can solve interesting problems through technology.

        Though he knows his journey has just begun, Ashish is a key member of the
        <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/">Groupon Engineering</a> team where he
        collaborates with talented individuals to build internal tools. While he is not
        coding & learning from awesome people around him, Ashish likes to dabble in
        cooking, occasional running & bike rides when the weather is nice, and
        excessive tweeting about any delays involving trains, planes and automobiles.

        <h3>Channel your inner Jason Bay: How to be productive on a new Team</h3>
        <p>
        You've landed a great opportunity to work with some of the smartest
        people in the industry. You can barely contain the enthusiasm to learn and
        contribute to the team. You may not have all the required technical skills on
        day 1, but you are confident that you will get there with the support from your
        team. It's exciting & stressful at the same time because you need to start
        contributing right away.
        </p>

        <p>
        A lot of developers find themselves in these shoes, just as I did in
        not-too-distant past. This talk offers specific strategies developers of all
        skill levels can use to start making an immediate impact. These strategies have
        enabled me to contribute quickly on a new team and I want to share it with you
        so that they can help you on each new project or team you work with. I also
        want to share specific gotchas and share some tips on how to adapt and continue
        to improve once you have become productive member of the team.
        </p>

        <p>The talk will primarily focus on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Techniques for quickly learning a new codebase</li>
          <li>Finding ways to have a significant impact quickly</li>
          <li>Ways in which you can continue to be more awesome</li>
        </ul>
